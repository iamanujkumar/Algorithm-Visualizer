# Algorithm Visualizer

![Visitor Count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=iamanujkumar.algorithm-visualizer)

A React-based application for visualizing a variety of algorithms. This project aims to provide an engaging and interactive way to understand complex algorithmic concepts through visualization.

## Live Demo

Live Application Visit : https://iamanujkumar.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/#/

## Features

The application includes visualizations for several algorithms, organized into the following segments:

### 1. Pathfinder
- Visualize graph algorithms such as Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS.

### 2. Recursion Tree
- Visualizes the process and function of recursion.

### 3. Sorting Algorithms
- Compare multiple sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

### 4. Recursive Sort
- Compare various recursive sorting algorithms.

### 5. Prime Numbers
- Demonstrates the Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime number visualization.

### 6. Convex Hull
- Illustrates the Graham Scan algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of points.

### 7. Binary Search Game
- An interactive game demonstrating the binary search algorithm.
